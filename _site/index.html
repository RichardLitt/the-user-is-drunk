      <h1>You can't test that. I'll do it for you.</h1>

      <p><b>WHAT</b>: I'll get very drunk, and then review your website. I'll send you a document outlining where I thought the website needed help, and a screencast of me going over the website.</p>
      <p><b>HOW MUCH</b>: $250 per site.</p>

      <p>More details:</p>
      <p>I am a UX professional and full stack developer. I've been doing this for a long time. Here is my <a class='website' href="http://burntfen.com">website</a>, my <a class='website' href="https://github.com/RichardLitt">github</a>, and my <a class='website' href="https://twitter.com/richlitt">twitter</a>.</p>
      <p>One of the core tenets of UX is that you've got to design like "the user is drunk." Any feature of your site has to be able to be used by someone who could be drunk - because, invariably, the user will mess it up otherwise. Wonderful idea. The thing is, it is hard to test.</p>
      <p> I and a lot of beer will test this for you.</p>

      <p>FAQ:</p>

      <p> • Will you actually do this? <i>Yes.</i></p>
      <p> • Can I pay you more to choose what you drink? <i>Very yes.</i></p>
      <!-- <p> • Can I pay you more to choose what you wear? <i>If I can find it, you buy it, I wears it.</i></p> -->
      <p> • Will you post your screencasts publicly? <i>Yes.</i></p>
      <p> • Is this your only job? <i>No. I have a full time job changing the world. This website is very much on the side, with no major ambitions.</i></p>
      <p> • Wasn't this cheaper earlier? <i>Yes. Raising my prices is my way of throttling the amount of jobs.</i></p>
      <p> • Serious: what about alcoholism? Addictive drinking is a real issue. <i>I intend to drink responsibly. I have close friends checking in with me regularly to make sure this doesn't become a problem. I'll do this once or twice a week, and limit the number of clients.</i></p>

      <p class='intern'>I also review websites from a UX perspective while sober. If you're interested in that, please get in touch.</p>

      <p class='intern'><i>Think of me like a user, but with a large knowledgebase on best practices, and no legal liability for your company. Actually, speaking of liability: I will ensure that I drink responsibly.  I take all blame if I accidentally do. I will ensure that I do not endanger anyone else in the process. You waive all responsibility for me upon payment. If you are concerned about me, please contact me. If you or your loved ones struggles with alcohol, talk to your doctor. Various types of therapy with real trained and certified therapists have good success rates backed by actual scientific evidence, as do certain prescription drugs. Combining them likely has an even better success rate. Drink responsibly. </i></p>
